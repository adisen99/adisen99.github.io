2022-12-07	Seasonal variations in the dynamic and thermodynamic response of precipitation extremes in the Indian subcontinent	Climate Dynamics	The major objectives of this study were three-fold. First, to analyse the seasonal cahnges in the apparent scaling rates over the Indian subcontinent and to determine the differences in the departure from the expected climate scaling rate using ERA5 reanalysis temperature and precipiatation data. Second, to use ERA5 data on pressure levels to determine the seasonal variations of the dynamic and thermodynamic contribution to precipitation extremes and find the factos that cause these deviations in scaling rates. Third, to further probe into these variations using composite analysis of the various climate variables as dynamic and thermodynamic indices to find the major driving factors behind extremes across seasons.

2023-04-10	Assessing the performance of satellite derived and reanalyses data in capturing seasonal changes in extreme precipitation scaling rates over the Indian subcontinent	Atmospheric Research	In the present study, the performance of three high resolution data sets - GPM-IMERG satellite derived, ERA5 and IMDAA reanalysis precipitation - in determining the seasonal variations in precipitation-temperature scaling rates are investigated. When compared with the IMD data, IMERG and IMDAA capture the spatial variations and magnitude of scaling rates of daily precipitation extremes much better than ERA5	Sengupta, A., Vissa, N.
