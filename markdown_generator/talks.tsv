Assessment of CMIP6 model capabilities in simulating the asymmetric response of precipitation to ENSO	Conference talk	talk-1	AMOS Conference 2024	2024-02-03	Canberra, Australia		Analysing the ability of CMIP6 models to simulate the asymmetric/nonlinear nature of ENSO-rainfall teleconnecitons in different regions of the world and seasons
Regional and seasonal diversity of ENSO-precipitation teleconections and their asymmetry in CMIP6 models	Conference talk	talk-2	International Meeting on Statistical Climatology	2024-06-28	Meteo-France, Toulouse, France	https://pacificclimate.org/~IMSC/5-Friday/2-Orals/S03/Sengupta.pdf	Going in-depth on the causes of ENSO-rainfall teleconnection biases in CMIP6 models, particularly the link between skewness of regional rainfall and complexity of ENSO teleconnctions
Changes in ENSO variability and teleconnections beyond net zero in ACCESS-ESM1.5	Conference talk	talk-3	Australian Academy of Science Elizabeth and Frederick White Research Conference on Atmospheric Dynamics	2024-08-01	Melbourne, Australia		How will ENSO and its teleconnections change once we achieve net-zero emissions. We use 1000-year long stabilisation runs from the ACCESS-ESM1.5 to analyse these changes and try to identify somef of the caveats of such an analysis at different global-warming levels.
Acceleration of local warming damped in urban regions of the Global South	Conference talk	talk-4	International Meeting on Statistical Climatology	2024-06-28	Meteo-France, Toulouse, France	https://pacificclimate.org/~IMSC/5-Friday/2-Orals/S12/Sengupta.pdf	Using multipled observation temperature datasets, we find that global warming is accelerating and many local regions also show a warming acceleration. Upon deeper investigation using population and economic datasets, it is revealed that temperature acceleration is lower in regions of high population and lower human development.
