Capturing the beautiful city of art and coffee through my lens.

A camera doesn't do justice to this magnificent city. One needs to visit the ineffable city to understand the true beauty that it is shrouded. To say I got a culture shock is putting it mildly. I have been living in one of the busiest, and biggest cities in world for all my life - Delhi, but the differences between the two are remarkable. Melbourne is a highly organised well planned city with an incredible gridded network, amazing tram connectivity, and one of the most happening Central Business District areas, with tall buildings, beautiful skyscape, restaurant of different cuisines, and amazing pubs, galleries and exhibitions throughout the city. I haven't even explored half of it yet.
