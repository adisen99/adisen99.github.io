My journey from India to Australia, from Delhi to Melbourne.

What a year it has been? From Rourkela to Delhi to Melbourne. The journey has been long and highly unpredictable, kinda like the weather in Melbourne. Since I was in high school, it was my dream to study abroad in a new culture to draw insights from the brightest minds who come from different backgrounds and nations but all share the same curiosity and penchant for the same field. During my Bachelor's, I applied for countless internship opportunities abroad, but was never selected in any one. Had spent almost 6 months researching universities and courses for Masters degree in Europe and Australia, but never got around to a formal application anywhere due to multiple reasons.

During my Master's degree at NITR, I got the opportunity to learn so much and make amazing new friends and unforgettable, tenable relationships that I am sure will last for a lifetime, but there was a desire to explore and grow more. I always felt that I just didn't belong and true potential can be uncapped only when you explore a community where you can be a global citizen and not just one of many. My thesis and research papers, plus my knowledge of international universities and courses didn't go in vain. After completing my Masters degree, I was depressed and upset since I failed to qualify both GATE and CSIR-NET (twice!!). I just felt PhD in India was not for me. I wanted more. So, I took 6 months, and applied, and applied and kept applying for graduate research positions abroad. But, sitting at home just applying and reading research papers is not exactly good for a 23 year old guy, whose parents are going daily to work hoping I will standing on my own two feet soon. That only pushes you more into depression and captivity.

My parents are most the supportive and loving human beings on the planet to me, but it was I who felt bad just sitting at home, and sending applications daily not knowing what my future looks like 6 months down the line. This period of transition can be grueling for many and I went through that and so did many of my friends. It hurts not knowing where your future lies and can be daunting. This is where your friends and loved ones come in, who support you and motivate you. Build strong relationships, and true friendships. You don't know when you may need them. Given my situation, I also started applying for relevant jobs and after hundreds of applications and countless rejections I got selected for the role of data scientist at Blue Sky Analytics (BSA). This was a silver lining. During my work with BSA, I learned a lot about VCS and managing data sets. New methods and tools, such as AWS, effective project management, and automation using modern machine learning and artificial intelligence tools and so much more. It was truly a great experience. At this point in time, I stopped making applications with any hope. I was content with my job and started looking at prospects to grow in the corporate arena on the bandwagon of one of the most promising climate-tech startups arguably in the world. But, in January, I got two offers from UNSW, Sydney and University of Melbourne with Scholarship to go and study towards a potential PhD degree. I was elated. But, at the same it was a tough choice to make since both projects and universit were exceptionally good, especially in the climate and earth sciences fields. Ultimately, I decided to go with University of Melbourne. There was no right answer to be fair, but looking back at it, I am extremely happy with my decision.

And, here I am, standing in front of the infamous UniMelb Welcome sign, which I had only seen pictures of. Saying goodbye to family, friends and my dear home has been extremely tough, and there are times where I just sit and wonder was it worth it. Only time will tell. But with a head full of big dreams and with an appetite for had work, I am setting of on 3 year long journey towards the title of Doctor, in front of my name. My love for wisdom will truly be tested now!!!!
