excerpt: 'In the present study, the performance of three high resolution data sets - GPM-IMERG satellite derived, ERA5 and IMDAA reanalysis precipitation - in determining the seasonal variations in precipitation-temperature scaling rates are investigated. When compared with the IMD data, IMERG and IMDAA capture the spatial variations and magnitude of scaling rates of daily precipitation extremes much better than ERA5'
