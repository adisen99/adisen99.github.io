excerpt: 'The major objectives of this study were three-fold. First, to analyse the seasonal cahnges in the apparent scaling rates over the Indian subcontinent and to determine the differences in the departure from the expected climate scaling rate using ERA5 reanalysis temperature and precipiatation data. Second, to use ERA5 data on pressure levels to determine the seasonal variations of the dynamic and thermodynamic contribution to precipitation extremes and find the factos that cause these deviations in scaling rates. Third, to further probe into these variations using composite analysis of the various climate variables as dynamic and thermodynamic indices to find the major driving factors behind extremes across seasons.'
