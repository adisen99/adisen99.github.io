I am a student currently pursuing a Doctor of Philosophy - Science from The University of Melbourne. My research during my PhD will be primarily focused on the study of climate variability under net-zero and negative carbon emission scenarios in future climate projections. I have a strong background in analyzing large volumes of data using python and I have strong academic writing and research oriented skills.

I am currently eagerly working on my PhD topic and exploring the beautiful city of Melbourne and wish to use this website and associated blog as a means of catharsis, to share my experiences and document my research progress kinda like a captain's log on a Star Trek mission across galaxies. Hope you find something useful on this website. I have a penchant for art and unconventional ideas and artistic perspectives and love watching sports and occasionally dabble in playing sports as well. I love hiking, reading books, and teaching has become one of the most cherished parts of my life in academia. On the home page I have some highlights of the some of the most important moments of my student life and academic career.

### Understanding Net Zero
_October 4th 2024_

[CleX](https://climateextremes.org.au) released its briefing note on Understanding Net Zero. As a researcher studying climate variability beyond Net Zero emissions, I often get asked what Net Zero even means. This briefing note, which I have co-authored contains an overview of the fundamentals of Net Zero emissions and what our climate is expected to look like in a world beyond net zero emissions looks like. The report has results of excellent research carried out by some of my amazing colleagues and friends  - [Alex Borowiak](https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/individuals/alex-borowiak) and [Liam Cassidy](https://theconversation.com/profiles/liam-cassidy-1470999) and my supervisor [Dr. Andrew King](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/690702-andrew-king). The article is wonderfully written by [Alice Wilson](https://climateextremes.org.au/profile/alicewilson/).\\
