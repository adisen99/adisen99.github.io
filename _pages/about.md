I am a student currently pursuing a Doctor of Philosophy - Science from The University of Melbourne. My research during my PhD will be primarily focused on the study of climate variability under net-zero and negative carbon emission scenarios in future climate projections. I have a strong background in analyzing large volumes of data using python and I have strong academic writing and research oriented skills.

I am currently eagerly working on my PhD topic and exploring the beautiful city of Melbourne and wish to use this website and associated blog as a means of catharsis, to share my experiences and document my research progress kinda like a captain's log on a Star Trek mission across galaxies. Hope you find something useful on this website. I have a penchant for art and unconventional ideas and artistic perspectives and love watching sports and occasionally dabble in playing sports as well xD. I don't know what more to write here. If I remember something, will add it for sure.

The contents on this website will keep updating statically, whenever I feel like updating them which I hope will be more frequent.
